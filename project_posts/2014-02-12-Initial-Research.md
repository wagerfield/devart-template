# Initial Research

Binary Trees are specialised graph structures which lend themselves to efficient search algorithms.
Such algorithms typically expect binary trees to be sorted in a specific way to facilitate their performance.
The robotic nature of these algorithms often causes them to break with anything other than the perfect input.

## Terminology & Properties

Binary Trees consist of 2 components: **[node]s** and **[edge]s**.

* A **node** is an abstract entity.
  - A node in a binary tree can have *no more than 2 child nodes*.
  - A **root** node is the only node in a tree that *has no parent*.
  - A **leaf** node is a node with *no child nodes*.
* An **edge** *connects* 2 nodes.
