## Description

Binary Question Tree is an exploration into generating and collecting organic binary data.
Participants are invited to answer a series of user–generated questions and then ask one of their own.
The only constraint on the question that can be asked is the response—it must yield **YES** or **NO**.

* Are you curious?
* Do you believe in fate?
* Have you ever wanted to be something else?

Submitted questions will become part of the tree—embedding themselves at the location where the user completed their journey—and will be answered by other participants following the same route through the tree.

**The physical manifestation of this project will be defined by the data collected in due course.**
