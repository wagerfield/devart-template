## Description

Binary Question Tree is an exploration into generating and collecting organic binary data.
Participants are invited to answer a series of user–generated questions and then ask one of their own.
The only constraint on the question that can be asked is the response—it must be **YES** or **NO**.

* Are you curious?
* Do you believe in a God?
* Have you ever wanted to be something else?

The physical manifestation of this project will be defined by the data collected in due course.
